When the code starts working, five cards are randomly generated and placed on the table. The generation of two cards for each player is also done randomly.

By comparing the cards in each player's hand with the card combinations on the table, the five with the best rank is selected. This is done for each player.

In the end, the player with the best card five wins the poker game.

The game of poker (at least as I know it) is dealt two cards to the player and five cards to the table.

By placing 3 cards instead of 5 cards on the table; Among the 5 cards in total, the best combination can well be determined. Changes to cycles and random card distribution codes are required.
